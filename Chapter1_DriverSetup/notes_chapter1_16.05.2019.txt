MongoClient

Smumary

We can use a MongoClient object to:

- Instantiate a connection to the database
- Gather information about a database or collection
- Create direct connections to collections, which we can issue queries against

Asynchronous Programming

Summary

We saw 3 different ways to handle asynchronous programming with the MongoDB Node driver, callbacks, promises, and async/await

A few things to remember:
- you should always wrap await statements with a try/catch block
- if you aren't comfortable with Promises, you can supply a callback to the driver methods that are asynchronous
- if you don't pass a callback, a Promise with be returned

########################################
Basic reads

Summary

We saw how to limit rhe results to one document or get all documents that match a query filter. We also saw how to include only the
fields we wanted in the result set, and how to remove the _id field.

A few things to keep in mind:
- Finding one document typically involves querying on a unique index, such as the _id field.
- When projecting, by specifying inclusion - {title: 1}  for example - all fields we don't include will be excluded, except for the 
  _id field. if we don't want the _id field to us we must explicity it, like { title: 1, _id: 0 }
